The North Wind and the Sun were arguing which one of them was stronger.
Then a traveler came along wearing a heavy coat.
They agreed that whoever first got the traveler to take off his coat,
would be considered stronger among them.
The North Wind blew as hard as he could.
But the harder he blew,
the tighter the traveler wrapped his coat around him.
Finally the North Wind had to give up.
After that the sun began to shine.
And the traveler immediately took off his coat.
And so the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was stronger.
